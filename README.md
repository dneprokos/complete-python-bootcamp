## installation

### Install python

Ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed on your system. If you do not have Python installed, or if your version is older than 3.11, follow the steps below to download and install the latest version:

1. Download Python:

Visit the official Python downloads page to download Python 3.11 or later for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux/UNIX).

2. Run the Installer:

Windows: Run the downloaded executable. Ensure to check the box that says "Add Python 3.11 to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".
macOS: Open the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installation instructions.
Linux/UNIX: You might be able to install Python using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you could use sudo apt-get install python3.11. Otherwise, follow the instructions provided on the download page for compiling and installing from source.

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify that Python has been installed correctly and is added to your system's PATH by opening a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS and Linux/UNIX) and running:

"python --version" or "python3 --version"

### Additional Notes
Windows Users: If Python was not added to your PATH during installation, you can do so manually via System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables, or reinstall Python and ensure to check the "Add Python to PATH" option.

macOS and Linux/UNIX Users: If python points to an earlier version, try using python3 to run Python 3.11 or later. You may also want to check your shell's configuration files (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc) for existing Python aliases or PATH modifications.

With Python installed and configured, you're ready to set up your project's environment and install its dependencies.
